Hello-World
===========

This is a sample repository that is used to learn the basics of GitHub. I will use this knowledge to save projects I have worked on in the past, both school and personal projects. Storing these projects will help me keep them in an orgainized format. And hopefully this will also make it easier to show them to potential employers.
